# Solution Steps

1. 1. Identify that the database driver is asyncpg, which requires proper async/await usage for all database operations.

2. 2. Notice the cause of the 500 error is likely due to not awaiting the async database operation or using synchronous code within async endpoints.

3. 3. Ensure a connection pool is initialized on FastAPI startup using 'asyncpg.create_pool'.

4. 4. Properly acquire a connection from the pool within the async route handler using 'async with db_pool.acquire() as connection:'.

5. 5. Await the database query using 'await connection.fetch(...)'.

6. 6. Transform asyncpg Record objects into Python dictionaries and then pydantic models, so FastAPI can return proper JSON responses.

7. 7. Implement error handling: If any exception occurs, respond with HTTP 500 and a user-friendly error message.

8. 8. On FastAPI shutdown, close the database pool gracefully.
